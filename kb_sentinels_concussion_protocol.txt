The Washington Sentinels use a five-stage concussion return-to-play protocol designed to prioritize player safety over game availability. 
Stage 0 is complete physical and cognitive rest until the player is symptom-free at baseline. 
Stage 1 allows light, symptom-limited activity such as walking or stationary cycling for no more than 20 minutes. 
Stage 2 adds light aerobic conditioning and position-specific footwork drills with no contact or risk of collisions. 
Stage 3 permits non-contact football activities, including route running, coverage drills, and walkthroughs at full speed. 
Stage 4 is a full-contact practice, followed by a final medical clearance evaluation. 
Players must remain at each stage for at least 24 hours; if symptoms return at any point, they are moved back one full stage and must be symptom-free for another 24 hours before progressing.

The Sentinels have several club-specific rules that are stricter than the standard league guidelines. 
A player can never be fully cleared on the same calendar day the concussion is diagnosed, even if symptoms quickly resolve. 
Any player who sustains a second diagnosed concussion in the same season must complete a minimum of seven symptom-free days at Stage 0 before re-entering the on-field progression. 
Only the Head Team Physician, or a designated backup physician listed on the weekly medical coverage sheet, may sign the final return-to-play clearance. 
Position coaches, the head coach, and the general manager are not allowed to overrule or pressure medical staff about a player’s clearance status.

Communication and documentation are also tightly controlled. 
All suspected concussions must be logged into the SentinelMed system within two hours of either the in-game event or post-game evaluation. 
Daily practice reports categorize each player as Out, Limited, or Full based on their current stage of the protocol, and these labels must match the medical record in SentinelMed. 
For nationally televised prime-time games, an independent neurological consultant must review the player’s file and co-sign the clearance before the athlete is allowed to participate. 
Failure to follow documentation rules can trigger an internal compliance review and potential fines for staff members who ignored or altered medical information.
